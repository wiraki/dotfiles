# Navigation Enhancement Guide

Quick reference for the new three-layer navigation system in your Neovim configuration.

## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Grapple - Project File Tagging
- `<leader>gt` - Toggle tag on current file
- `<leader>gn` - Jump to next tagged file
- `<leader>gp` - Jump to previous tagged file
- `<leader>gm` - Open tag menu (visual picker)

### Portal - Visual History Navigation
- `<leader>j` - Jump backward through jumplist
- `<leader>J` - Jump forward through jumplist
- `<leader>k` - Navigate backward through changelist
- `<leader>K` - Navigate forward through changelist

### Existing Navigation (unchanged)
- `<leader>sf` - Find files (Telescope)
- `<leader>sg` - Live grep (Telescope)
- `<leader><leader>` - Switch buffers (Telescope)
- `S` - Flash treesitter jump
- `<C-h/j/k/l>` - Navigate vim/tmux panes

## üéØ Three-Layer Workflow

### 1. Project Level - Grapple Tags
**Use for**: 3-5 most important files you're actively working on

```
Working on a React component:
1. Open src/components/UserProfile.jsx
2. Press <leader>gt to tag it
3. Open src/hooks/useUserData.js
4. Press <leader>gt to tag it
5. Open src/types/user.ts
6. Press <leader>gt to tag it

Now use <leader>gn and <leader>gp to cycle between these key files!
```

### 2. File Discovery - Telescope
**Use for**: Finding files you haven't tagged yet

```
Looking for a specific file:
- <leader>sf - Find files by name
- <leader>sg - Search for text across files
- <leader>sr - Resume last search
```

### 3. Location History - Portal
**Use for**: Navigating through your editing history with visual context

```
Following a debugging trail:
1. Start in main.js
2. Go to definition (gd) ‚Üí lands in utils.js
3. Go to definition (gd) ‚Üí lands in config.js
4. Go to definition (gd) ‚Üí lands in constants.js
5. Press <leader>j to see visual jumplist
6. Select where you want to go back to
```

## üìã Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature
```
1. Use <leader>sf to find the main file you'll edit
2. Press <leader>gt to tag it
3. Follow references/definitions to find related files
4. Tag the 2-3 most important ones with <leader>gt
5. Use <leader>gn/<leader>gp to cycle between them as you work
```

### Debugging/Investigation
```
1. Start at the bug location
2. Use LSP navigation (gd, gr, gI) to follow the code
3. Use <leader>j to see your investigation path visually
4. Jump back to important points in your investigation
5. Tag key files you discover with <leader>gt
```

### Context Switching
```
Each git repository has separate Grapple tags:
- Project A: Your 3-5 tagged files
- Project B: Different set of 3-5 tagged files
- Use <leader>j to remember where you left off
```

### Refactoring Sessions
```
1. Tag files you're refactoring with <leader>gt
2. Make changes across multiple files
3. Use <leader>k to navigate through your change history
4. Jump back to see what you changed where
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Grapple Best Practices
- **Keep it focused**: Only tag 3-5 files per project
- **Tag workflow files**: Main component, its test, related hook/util
- **Use the menu**: `<leader>gm` shows all tags with file previews
- **Git-scoped**: Tags are per-repository, perfect for project switching

### Portal Best Practices
- **Visual selection**: Portal shows you context, not just file names
- **Jumplist**: Use `<leader>j` after following multiple gd/gr commands
- **Changelist**: Use `<leader>k` to see where you made recent edits
- **Combined power**: Use both together - jump to location, then see recent changes

### Integration Tips
- **Start broad**: Use `<leader>sf` to find files
- **Tag frequently**: Press `<leader>gt` on important files immediately
- **Navigate visually**: Use `<leader>j` instead of `<C-o>` for better context
- **Follow the flow**: gd ‚Üí gd ‚Üí gd ‚Üí `<leader>j` ‚Üí select destination

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Grapple Issues
- **Tags not persisting**: Make sure you're in a git repository
- **No tags showing**: Use `<leader>gm` to see if any files are tagged
- **Can't cycle**: Need at least 2 tagged files for `<leader>gn`/`<leader>gp`

### Portal Issues
- **Empty jumplist**: Make some jumps first (gd, `<C-o>`, etc.)
- **No changes**: Portal changelist needs recent edits in current session
- **Too many results**: Portal limits to 10 entries for performance

### General Tips
- **Learn gradually**: Start with just `<leader>gt` and `<leader>j`
- **Build habits**: Tag files as soon as you know they're important
- **Visual feedback**: Portal shows you where you've been, not just where you can go
- **Muscle memory**: Use these instead of switching to file explorer

## üéâ Getting Started

1. **Week 1**: Just use `<leader>gt` to tag important files and `<leader>gn`/`<leader>gp` to cycle
2. **Week 2**: Add `<leader>j` when you get lost following code references
3. **Week 3**: Use `<leader>k` to navigate through your recent changes
4. **Week 4**: Combine all three layers for maximum efficiency

Remember: This enhances your existing workflow - Telescope, Flash, and tmux navigation all work exactly the same!
